My name is Josh Yamamoto and I'm finishing up my final year as a Mathematics & Statistics major at Reed College. I have been lucky enough to interact with data science in a wide variety of settings and flavors. Out of those experiences grew my primary interest: a deep passion for propagating thoughtfulness and intentionality in all of the ways that data science gets done. While I have a special love for solving very technical problems, I care just as much about how those problems get solved.

I have a lot of research experience having done social justice computer science research at Reed College, biostatistics research at a joint program at Duke & NC State, and most recently forestry data science research at Harvard University. Each of these programs have been both deeply technical and deeply collaborative, giving me a strong appreciation for how important partnership is to solving difficult problems. 

I also have done work as a data science consultant at my college for the last three years, advising and implementing programs in R and other data technologies to catalyze research efforts by faculty and student researchers. I have also served as a course assistant and tutor for machine learning, and introductory statistics courses. While I always enjoy solving technical problems, I get just as much joy out of aiding and equiping other people to learn and solve problems themselves.

I'm looking for a job at a place where I can be a part of building tools for data scientists and statisticians.
