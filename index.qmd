Hello! I'm a Mathematics & Statistics undergraduate student at Reed College. My technical interests lie in bayesian statistics, small area estimation, and statistical software, and I'm especially passionate about propagating thoughtfullness and intentionality into how we do those things. I'm more interested in the why and the how than I am in the final results of the models that I build and the software that I write.
